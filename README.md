# Skin Pack Injector
**Skin Pack Injector** is a tool that allows you to easily import your skin packs without digging into your system folders or using side programs.  
It’s fully **open source**, so you can view, edit, and reuse the code freely.

The application is **free**, **secure**, and **collects no data**.

# Requirements
To use **Skin Pack Injector**, you need the original edition of **Minecraft Bedrock**.

# How to Use
You need to run the program as **Administrator** to access the Minecraft Bedrock files.  
Once opened, select the folder of your skin pack.  
After choosing it, the logs will appear and show all actions performed, as well as when the process is complete.  
Once it's finished, you can close the window — **everything is ready**.

You can now open Minecraft Bedrock with your custom skin pack injected.

# ❗ Warning
All modifications are allowed, but redistribution of the edited program is not.
